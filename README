Text slides for the terminal.

Install textorama anywhere in your path,
then create a file with your slides:

    $ cat slides
    ---
    Hello world
    ---
    Enjoy the presentation
    ---
    Questions?
    ---
    Thanks!

Then proceed to display the slides:

    $ textorama ./slides

As it opens the slides with less, you can
move to the next page with 'f' and to the
previous page with 'b'.

Dependencies: textorama requires the rc
shell from Plan 9, the ed editor, and
nroff. Chances are the only thing missing
in your environment is rc, which is very
recommended if you like shell scripting.

Mac users can install rc with Homebrew:

    $ brew install rc

For Linux users, `apt-get install rc` or
similar should do the trick.
