Text slides for the terminal.

Install textorama anywhere in your path,
then create a file with your slides:

    $ cat slides
    ---
    Hello world
    ---
    Enjoy the presentation
    ---
    Questions?
    ---
    Thanks!

Then proceed to display the slides:

    $ textorama ./slides

As it opens the slides with less, you can
move to the next page with 'f' and to the
previous page with 'b'.
